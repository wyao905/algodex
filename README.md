# Algodex
Algodex is a front-end single page application built using React. The goal of the application is to provide a visualization of what goes on during the runtime of an algorithm.

The project started of as a way to keep track of the different algorithms I have come across. It also provided an excellent opportunity for me to experiment and play around with more complex component and state interactions. This project will remain as a work in progress as I'm looking to add additional algorithms in the near future.

## Instructions
Start off by selecting which algorithm to see from the drop down.

For sorting algorithms, select the initial array size to be sorted (size is limited to be between 1 and 100). Click the 'Generate' button to see the intial array that was created. Click the 'Start' button to see the algorithm in action!

For pathing algorithms, choose a starting point and end point by clicking on a grid. After the points are set, you can then draw some walls (shown as black grid boxes) to add some boundaries to the pathing. Clicking on a wall will remove it. Finally, click the 'Start' button.
